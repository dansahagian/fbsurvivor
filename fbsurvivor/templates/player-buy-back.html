        <p>Each player is allowed to buy back after their first loss. If you buy back, you are a
        survivor and competing for the big pot again. You must choose to buy back or decline to
        continue to the board.

        If you select to buy back, please send $30 to {{ venmo }} on Venmo. Questions? Email me at
